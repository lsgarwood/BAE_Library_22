## Imporvements ##
- My frontend really let my project down, an now I see that the order in which I worked could have been better. I was definitely avoiding doing the Javascript as I was not very confident with that, but that just led me into over developing other areas and then the functionality was lacking in the end product, but it was too late. It would have been better if I had concentrated on the CRUD functionality to meet MVP first, then I could have built it up from there.
- I overcomplicated my table and search functions from the beginning too, which also led me to waste time on extra backend development and testing, which could have been better spent developing the frontend to a more acceptable standard.
- I would also like to link my GitHub and Jira board and use the issuekeys when pushing my work in future projects.
- This API would have benefitted hugely from images, so given more time I could figure out a better way of doing this.
